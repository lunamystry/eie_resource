Cloning
-------

Cloning, also called Imaging is where you copy one computer
installation from one computer to another. This is done using
Clonezilla in the Dlab. It allows us to create a single image and
deploy it all the machines quickly.

This is a guide to clonezilla specific to the Dlab. Clonezilla is a
partition and disk imaging/cloning program. It comes in two flavors,
Clonezilla Live and Clonezilla Server Edition. Clonezilla Live comes
as a CD. It is useful for single machine cloning and deploying.
Clonezilla Server Edition is installed on a server. It is great for
general cloning and deploying. This guide provides a guide for
Clonezilla Server Edition.

**Requirements :**

- Server with Ubuntu 12.04 (LTS)

The server should have clonezilla installed (see
:doc:`clonezilla_se_installation` for installation instructions)
