Responsibilities

So you are administrating the Dlab now. Don't mess it up! This is a guide to
some things which you have to do as an Administrator of the Dlab.

* Load paper in the printers

* Check emails sent to the Dlabadmin@eie.wits.ac.za account

* Approve/Reject/Defer emails sent to the undergrad mailing list

* Update the list of computers on Resource.eie.wits.ac.za to let people know
  which computers work and which don't

* Inform fourth and third year students if there is a booking in the lab

* Enforce rules of the Dlab, such a 'No eating in the lab'

* Send the network supervisor a report of paper usage before his Monday meeting with in the
  School.

* Assign students lockers and cut the padlocks if they don't take their stuff
  out in time.

* Once in a while let the network supervisor know of what is working and not working in the
  lab such as ports or broken computers, why the particular thing is not
  working and when it will be fixed

* Make sure that all all computers are working fully

* Be there when the lab is booked for techinical assistance

* Make sure all the printers are working

* Add and manage users from the LDAP server

  temperature sensor for the server room or configuring a new piece of
  equipment that the School just bought for the lab)


Refilling paper in the Printers
-------------------------------

Paper is fetched from the School reception. There is a little form that has to
be filled in to say paper was take for the Dlab. Different administrators over
the years have had different ways of dealing with fetching paper, some waited
for the paper to run out on all the printers before it was refilled, some
choose to keep boxes of reams in the office and refill as needed. It is up to
you to choose how you want to do it. Let the network supervisor know how you
want to do it.

Printer Toner
-------------

Toner has to be ordered, I can't remember how. I did it like twice.

Faulty or Broken equipment
--------------------------

If a piece of equipment is broken in the lab, it is taken to the workshop for
to be fixed. The computers (as far as I know) have a really nice service
warranty. Speak to David if you want detail. 

Lights, doors, windows and air conditioning are handled by PIMD. Their contact
detail can be found all over Wits. 

CNS
---

The CNS controls the following things:

* Wi-Fi

* Internet access (via Proxy)

* Email and Proxy passwords

If there are problem any of these things, they can be refered to CNS if the
network supervisor cannot help.

The Windows that is running in the Lab was obtained from the CNS, the updates
to windows are suppose to be done through the CNS (to save on bandwidth), but
this has not been configured.
